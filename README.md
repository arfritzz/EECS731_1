I choose the public health sector for this project. I looked at the trend in overall life expectancy and some factors that could contribute to the increase in overall life expectancy. 

Particularly, I studied the relationship between clean drinking water in the US and Nigeria. 

## Data Sets 

All data sets I found included information about most countries. I had to refine them to only include the counties I was intersted in studying. 

People using safely managed drinking water services (% of population) - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.H2O.SMDW.ZS?view=chart

Life expectancy at birth, total (years) - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?view=chart

Cholera Dataset - https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/cholera-dataset

## How could they be combined to establish additional value? 

One way to combine the data sets is a line graph of the trend as time progresses. We can see that people using safely managed drinking water increases, life expectancy at birth increases. 

Another way to combine them is to look at a specific year, and see what regions or areas have the highest percentage of people using safely managed drinking water. Then, you could look at the life expectacy at birth of that area and see if it above average combared to the world as a whole.  

We can look at the countries with the least amount of people using safely managed drinking water sources and see if the cholera levels are higher for that area as Cholera can be a result of drinking contaminated water. 

## Results 

I tested my thoughts by first specifically looking at how life expectancy increases as the percent of the population drinking clean water increases in Nigeria. I found this to be true. 

I then looked at a specific year, 2017, and compared Nigeria to the United States in terms of life expectancy and percent of the population drinking clean water. I saw that both percent of the population drinking clean water and life expectancy is higher in the United States. 

I concluded there could be a relationship between percent of the population drinking clean water and life expectancy. It is know that having clean drinking water is necessary for life, and this data reenforces that.
