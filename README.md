# Industry 

One of the things I enjoy most is exercising. So, for this project I chose to look at the health and wellness industry to examine the benefits of exercise. Some of my leading questions are 

1. Does exercise lead to happiness? 
2. In general, how much of the population considers themselves fit? 
3. How do people track their exercise? 
4. Are people who track their exercise more likely to complete daily exercise goals?
