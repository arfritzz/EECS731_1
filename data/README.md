## Where did I get the data? 

People using safely managed drinking water services (% of population) - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.H2O.SMDW.ZS?view=chart

Life expectancy at birth, total (years) - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?view=chart

## What data did I use? 

I reworked the data and redownloaded the updated files in the `life_N.csv` `life_US.csv` `water_N.csv` `water_US.csv`
