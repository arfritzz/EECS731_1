## Where did I get the data? 

People using safely managed drinking water services (% of population) - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.H2O.SMDW.ZS?view=chart

Life expectancy at birth, total (years) - https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.LE00.IN?view=chart

## What data did I analyze? 

I took the data from the file `data.csv` in the folder LifeExpectancyAtBirth. I also used data from the file `water.csv` in the folder PeopleUsingSafeWater. 

I reworked the data and redownloaded the updated files in the `life_N.csv` `life_US.csv` `water_N.csv` `water_US.csv`


## Sidenode

In addition, I also wanted to look at Cholera, a water born bacteria, to see it's effects on life expectancy. I thought if the population exhibited more cases of Cholera, then the life expectancy would decrease. However, when looking and analyzing the data, I found no relationship between life expectancy and number of Cholera cases so I dismissed my hypothesis.
