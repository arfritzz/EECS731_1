In this folder, I have three different notebook groups of interest. First, I have the `water` group where I imported and edited the data for Nigeria and the US. Then I have the `life` folder where I imported and edited the data for life expectancy in Nigeria and the US. Finally, I have the notebook titled `CombiningLifeandWater` which is the final result of my project.
