### Final result 

To see my final results, please look in the `CombiningLifeandWater` Notebook. 

### Supporting Notebooks

In this folder, I have three different notebook groups of interest. First, I have the `water` group where I imported and edited the data for Nigeria and the US. Then I have the `life` folder where I imported and edited the data for life expectancy in Nigeria and the US. Finally, I have the notebook titled `CombiningLifeandWater` which is the final result of my project. 

The `cholera` notebook was preliminary as I wanted to compare the data for the number of cholera cases with the trend in clean drinking water but there was no clear relationship.
